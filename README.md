1. Explain what a blockchain is, in my own words:

A blockchain is a trustless shared database that ideally doesn't have a single point of failure (other than the internet in entirety.) It can allow people to transact resources in the form of "tokens" (fungible or non,) in a manner that can't be exploited, easily anyhow.

2. Explain what a smart contract is:

A smart contract is a program that runs on the blockchain. The perks are being able to form a pool of custom-made tokens, fungible or non, and perhaps shouldering some server costs by offloading mission critical code to that virtual machine.

3.Explain the difference between a transaction and a script:

A transaction changes the data of a smart contract in some way. A script only views the data, without modifying it.
